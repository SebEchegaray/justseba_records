### RECORDS App

## What it is
  * This is an app where I can ADD, EDIT, UPDATE or DELETE records and also create a USER ACCOUNT in order to be able to do any of the ones mentioned before.

## How to use it
  * This is an app where you can browse and find records as well as manage information for each of them
  * The way it works:
    * You can browse the website and see records in the RECORDS section, but you won't be able to UPDATE, DELETE or ADD new records if you are not logged in.
    * To log in, you need to create an account (SIGN UP), so that you have the ability to then login and play around with the record's information if you wish.

## My approach
  * I started from the CREATE part 
  * Step by step, I built each part of the CRUD app and commiting as they were working for a safe approach.
  * I also used Sessions to have users so if you are logged in then you can EDIT, DELETE or ADD records.

## Lessons I have learnt
  * I definitely learnt and understood a whole lot more about sessions with some help from instructors as well as on the way. Building it and trying not to look over old code_alongs was a big help as sometimes I was finding errors that never seen before and I was able to fix them by following the path and checking spelling, variable names, methods names, etc.
